Project Structure:

Directory: The project is contained within a directory named school_demo. Files: The main PHP files are: index.php, create.php, view.php, edit.php, delete.php, and classes.php. Database: The MySQL database is named school_db, and it contains two tables: student and classes. Images: Uploaded images are stored in the uploads directory within the project. Functionality:

Home Page (index.php): Displays a list of all students with their name, email, class, creation date, and image thumbnail. Provides links to view, edit, and delete each student. Uses a JOIN query to fetch the class name associated with each student. Create Student (create.php): Presents a form to input student details (name, email, address, class, and image). Validates input (name not empty, image format). Uploads the image to the server. Inserts the new student into the database. Redirects to the home page. Uses a JOIN query to populate the class dropdown. View Student (view.php): Displays the full details of a student (name, email, address, class, image, and creation date). Uses a JOIN query to fetch the class name. Edit Student (edit.php): Presents a form pre-filled with the student's current details. Allows updating details and uploading a new image (optional). Validates input (name not empty, image format if uploaded). Updates the student in the database. Redirects to the home page. Uses a JOIN query to populate the class dropdown. Delete Student (delete.php): Confirms the deletion of a student. Deletes the student and its image from the server and database. Redirects to the home page. Manage Classes (classes.php): Displays a list of all classes. Provides options to add, edit, and delete classes. Implements forms and database interactions for class management. Additional Notes:

Database Connection: Replace placeholders in the code with your actual database credentials. Error Handling & Sanitization: Implement proper error handling and input sanitization to enhance security and robustness. Styling: Basic CSS or a CSS framework like Bootstrap is used for styling. Further Enhancements: Consider adding features like pagination, search functionality, and more advanced image handling.
